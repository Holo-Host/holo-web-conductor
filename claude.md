# Fishy

## Overview

This project is a browser extension-based implementation of the Holochain conductor as implemented in https://github.com/holochain/holochain/ as well as lair keystore as implemented in https://github.com/holochain/lair.

The Holochain repo is a large mono-repo and the portions to be implemented here would be the ability for a browser based UI to run a holochain hApp wasm in the browser and have the extension take on the host side actions which sign and store source chain data along with making network calls for which it will have a different http gateway based approach rather than using the network protocols as defined in kitsune2.

## Assumptions that differentiate this implementation from the full distributed Holochain implementation

1. These nodes do not gossip, they are considered zero-arc and thus get all data from the network (though they may cache data especially content-addressable data)
2. The identifying context of the hApp is directly obtained from the domain name from which the happ UI and wasm is downloaded.
3. Agency (i.e. the private key pair) for a given hApp context is stored in a local data base mirroring Lair functionality for signing.
4. Node are not expected to have progenitor status on a Holochain network i.e. they are all operating in a context where other always on nodes exist.
5. TODO Bootstrapping assumptions?

### Step 2.5: Lair UI Integration

**Goal**: Add UI in extension popup for Lair key management before implementing web page authorization.

**Dependencies**: Step 2 (Lair client)

**Sub-tasks**:
1. **2.5.1** Implement lock/unlock mechanism
   - Explore WebAuthn/Passkeys API for modern authentication
   - Fallback to passphrase-based if WebAuthn not suitable
   - Lock state persists across browser restarts
2. **2.5.2** Create keypair management UI
   - Create new keypairs with tag and exportable flag
   - List existing keypairs with metadata
   - Delete keypairs (with confirmation)
3. **2.5.3** Implement sign/verify operations in UI
   - Text input for data to sign
   - Display signature in base64
   - Verify signatures from other keypairs
4. **2.5.4** Implement export/import functionality
   - Export keypairs with passphrase-based encryption
   - Enforce exportable flag (non-exportable keys cannot be exported)
   - Import encrypted keypairs
   - Follow security model from original Lair
5. **2.5.5** Add Lair operations to background service worker
   - Message types for all Lair operations
   - Handlers that check lock state before operations
   - Only accessible from extension popup (not web pages)
6. **2.5.6** Write tests for UI operations
   - Lock/unlock flow
   - Create/list/delete keypairs
   - Sign/verify operations
   - Export/import with encryption

**Key Files**:
- `packages/extension/src/popup/lair.html` - Lair management UI
- `packages/extension/src/popup/lair.ts` - UI logic
- `packages/extension/src/lib/lair-lock.ts` - Lock/unlock mechanism
- `packages/extension/src/lib/lair-export.ts` - Export/import with encryption
- `packages/extension/src/background/index.ts` - Add Lair message handlers
- `packages/extension/src/lib/messaging.ts` - Add Lair message types

**Tests**:
- Lock/unlock mechanism works correctly
- Keypair operations only work when unlocked
- Export respects exportable flag
- Import/export round-trip with passphrase
- UI properly displays key information

**Design Decisions**:
- Lair operations NOT exposed through window.holochain API (popup only)
- Passphrase-based export/import for simplicity
- Strict enforcement of exportable flag
- Lock state persists across restarts

**Implementation Notes** (Step 2.5 Complete ✓):
- Used Web Crypto API PBKDF2 instead of libsodium crypto_pwhash (Argon2id) for broader browser compatibility
- Integrated export/import methods directly into LairClient instead of separate lair-export.ts file
- Passphrase-based lock/unlock chosen over WebAuthn/Passkeys for v1 (can add WebAuthn later)
- Chrome message passing serialization handled with toUint8Array() helper pattern
- Files created: lair.html (9.74KB), lair.ts (474 lines), lair-lock.ts (311 lines)
- Methods added to LairClient: exportSeedByTag(), importSeed(), deleteEntry()
- 13 new message types added for Lair operations
- All functionality verified working in Chrome browser

## Requirements, Tradeoffs & Dev Instructions

1. Each step of the process must be built using test-driven development practices such that CI can confirm no regressions before merging a PR
2. **User testing is required before commits**: After implementing features, user testing must be performed in a real browser environment before creating git commits. This ensures functionality works as expected.
3. Different portions of the plan, or even the same plan may be worked on from different workstations, so claude must be set up to pick up sessions where they were left off.
4. Perfect is the enemy of the good. This plan should not be implemented to the highest possible standard of efficiency or robustness, but rather in a way that allows for reaching the functionality goals in reasonable time, and iterating on quality goals over time.
5. Don't add claude co-authored/generated messages in commit descriptions

## Technical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Web Crypto API limitations | May not support all Ed25519 operations | Use libsodium.js (sodium-native) as fallback |
| WASM memory limits in extension | Large hApps may fail | Implement streaming/chunking, test with real hApps early |
| Extension ↔ Page communication security | XSS/injection risks | Use structured cloning, validate all messages |
| IndexedDB size limits | May hit storage caps | Implement LRU cache for DHT data, keep source chain complete |
| hc-http-gw compatibility | API may change | Pin to specific version, abstract network layer |
| Cross-browser compatibility | Firefox/Chrome differences | Use webextension-polyfill, test on both |

---

## Session Continuity

To support picking up work across sessions:

1. **This file** (`claude.md`) serves as the source of truth for project state
2. **Git commits** should be atomic and well-described
3. **TODO comments** in code should reference step numbers (e.g., `// TODO(Step 5.3): implement agent_info`)
4. **Each step** should be completable in isolation once dependencies are met
5. **Tests** verify step completion - all tests pass = step complete
